Hi! I am Simone Paradiso, currently a postdoc at INAF-OAS (Bologna, Italy). My primary research focus is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). I work on both the observational end --specifically on the data analysis, component separation, likelihood and cosmological parameters estimation-- and on the theoretical one, mostly on probing physics beyond the standard model through cosmic birefringence, and probing the reionization history of the Universe. I am also a statistical cosmology enthusiast, and have done some work on this topic during my postdoc in Canada (look up for the papers!).
