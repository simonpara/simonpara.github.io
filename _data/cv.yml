        - title: CMB Likelihood and Cosmological Parameter estimation in a Bayesian end-to-end framework.
          contents:
            - Study of the reionization history of the Universe through CMB data.
            - Development of an end-to-end Bayesian framework to analyse CMB data, from raw time ordered data to cosmological parameters estmiation. This work has been carried on within the BeyondPlanck project, and my focus has been on CMB map estimation, likelihood implementation and cosmological parameters estimation.
